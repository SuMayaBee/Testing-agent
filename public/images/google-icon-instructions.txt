To fix the missing Google icon:

1. Download the Google "G" logo:
   - You can find it at: https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/ui/2.0.0/images/auth/google.svg
   - Or search for "Google G Logo" on Google Images

2. Save it in this directory as "google-icon.png"

3. Make sure the image is appropriately sized (20px-30px width)

This icon will be displayed in the "Sign in with Google" button on your login page.
