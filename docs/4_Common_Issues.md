# Common Issues and Troubleshooting

This document covers common issues you might encounter when working with the Testing Agent Frontend and how to resolve them.

## API Connection Issues

### Problem: Cannot connect to backend API

**Symptoms:**
- Error messages in console: "Network Error" or "Failed to fetch"
- API calls failing
- Loading states that never resolve

**Possible Causes:**
1. Backend server is not running
2. Incorrect API base URL in environment variables
3. CORS issues
4. Network connectivity problems

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure the backend server is running and accessible
2. Check that `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in `.env.local` points to the correct URL
3. Verify CORS is properly configured on the backend
4. Check your network connection and firewall settings

## Authentication Issues

### Problem: Unauthorized API Access

**Symptoms:**
- 401 Unauthorized responses
- Unable to access protected routes
- Automatically redirected to login screen

**Solutions:**
1. Check if your authentication token is valid
2. Ensure you've selected an organization from the dropdown
3. Verify your user has the necessary permissions
4. Check for token expiration and implement proper refresh logic

## UI and Rendering Issues

### Problem: Components not rendering as expected

**Symptoms:**
- Blank screens
- Missing data in components
- Visual elements misaligned or incorrectly styled

**Solutions:**
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify that data is being properly loaded from the API
3. Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly
4. Test in different browsers to identify browser-specific issues
5. Clear browser cache and reload

### Problem: Slow performance

**Symptoms:**
- UI feels sluggish
- Long load times
- High CPU usage

**Solutions:**
1. Check for unnecessary re-renders using React DevTools
2. Optimize API calls and implement caching where appropriate
3. Use memoization techniques (useMemo, useCallback)
4. Consider code splitting for larger components

## Form Handling Issues

### Problem: Form submission errors

**Symptoms:**
- Form doesn't submit
- Validation errors persist despite correct input
- Unexpected behavior after submission

**Solutions:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify form validation logic
3. Ensure all required fields are properly filled out
4. Check API response for error messages
5. Verify form state management

## Navigation and Routing Issues

### Problem: Routing not working correctly

**Symptoms:**
- URLs change but content doesn't update
- 404 errors when accessing direct URLs
- Navigation links not working

**Solutions:**
1. Check Router configuration in App.jsx
2. Ensure routes are properly defined and in the correct order
3. Verify that links use the correct paths
4. Check for issues with route parameters

## Development Environment Issues

### Problem: Development server won't start

**Symptoms:**
- Error messages when running `npm run dev`
- Process exits immediately

**Solutions:**
1. Check for syntax errors in your code
2. Ensure all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
3. Verify Node.js version (16.x+ required)
4. Check if another process is using port 5173

### Problem: Hot reload not working

**Symptoms:**
- Changes to code don't reflect in the browser
- Need to manually refresh to see changes

**Solutions:**
1. Check if Vite is running correctly
2. Ensure file system watching is enabled
3. Restart the development server
4. Check for syntax errors that might break the hot reload

## State Management Issues

### Problem: Component state not updating

**Symptoms:**
- UI not reflecting the latest data
- Actions don't seem to have any effect
- Inconsistent behavior between components

**Solutions:**
1. Verify state update functions are called correctly
2. Check for issues with the context providers
3. Use React DevTools to inspect component state
4. Ensure proper component re-rendering is triggered
